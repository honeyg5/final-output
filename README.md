1. Implement React components and use props for passing data between components.
2. Apply state management using the useState Hook to update and display dynamic data.
3. Design a form component that allows adding new products to the list.
4. Use JavaScript array methods such as .map() and .reduce() to render data and calculate 
totals.
5. Display computed values such as subtotal per product and overall total for all products.
6. Practice clean code organization and UI presentation for usability and clarity.
